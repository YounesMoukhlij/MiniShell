# Minishell

This project was one of the most challenging yet indulging projects of the 42 curriculum that I have faced so far, when you have to deal with many test cases and when you get to learn many things, from software architecture, system calls, file descriptorsâ€¦ to team coordination, management, and work distribution.

Building a shell that mimics the bash was an intimidating thing for me at first, because the only thing that I knew back then about shells was how to use them, in a basic way to accomplish basic tasks, but I was not really aware of how they internally work or function, and building a shell from scratch was really a challenging task for me, though this is one of the main things that I do really like about the 42 pedagogy, is that I always keep finding myself at a challenge, always trying to learn something new, from the early days of the Piscine (42 selection phase) up to writing this article.
